## 🏆 Winning Strategy

1. **Start with Easy** - Build confidence
2. **Time management** - Don't spend too long on any one challenge
3. **Test frequently** - Validate your fixes incrementally
4. **Read instructions** - Each challenge has detailed README
5. **Stay calm** - Debugging requires patience

---

## 💡 Tips & Guidelines

### Do's ✅
- Read the entire README for each challenge
- Test your code frequently
- Use debugging prints to trace issues
- Ask for clarification if instructions are unclear
- Manage your time across all three challenges

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't refactor working code unnecessarily
- Don't skip testing
- Don't make random changes hoping they work
- Don't spend all time on one challenge

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Internet Access**: You may use internet resources, documentation, and AI tools
2. **Original Work**: Your implementations must be your own
3. **Testing**: Use provided validators to check your solutions
4. **Submission**: Ensure all code runs without errors
5. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code earns bonus points

---

## 🎯 Challenge Difficulty Guide

**Easy**: If you know basic pathfinding algorithms
**Medium**: If you can debug complex algorithmic code
**Hard**: If you understand deep learning and transformers

Pick challenges that match your skill level, but don't be afraid to try harder ones!

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Can I use external libraries?**
A: Yes, for Easy challenge. Medium and Hard challenges should use only the specified dependencies.

**Q: How much time should I spend on each?**
A: Easy (45 min), Medium (60 min), Hard (75 min) - but adjust based on your progress.

**Q: Can I skip a challenge?**
A: Yes! Focus on challenges where you can score maximum points.

**Q: Are AI tools like ChatGPT allowed?**
A: Yes, but note that harder challenges are designed to resist AI assistance. Understanding is key.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Move to another challenge and come back if time permits. Partial credit is available.

**Q: Can I work in a team?**
A: Check with organizers for team rules.
